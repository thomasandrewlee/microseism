This code will read in spectral data from a given station (e.g., HRV)
and will calculate the climatology (i.e., annual average) spectra for
the time step and window desired (e.g., daily steps, 7-day average).

These spectra can then be used to compute the transfer functions to 
correct for noise differences at different times of the year, for
example, in a code like the EQ doublet calculation.
